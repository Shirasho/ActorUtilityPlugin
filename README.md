# Actor Utility Plugin

This plugin is for use with Unreal Engine 4.11 and earlier. It exposes an method which allows attaching an arbitrary component to an AActor by passing in a component class instead of a reference to an existing component.

Starting with 4.12 (or 4.13 - I've been away for a while) these functions are now exposed natively under different names and do not need this plugin.
